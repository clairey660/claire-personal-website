        <h3>What is TypeScript?</h3>
        <p>

            Typescript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript. Meaning that Typescript builds on JavaScript by
            adding static typing TypeScript code is transpiled into JavaScript, making it compatible with all JavaScript
            environments and browsers.

        </p>
        <h3>What are the advantages of using TypeScript for Web Development?</h3>
        <p>
            Static typing enables developers to declare types, which effectively catches type-related errors during
            development, making debugging easier. TypeScript enhances code readability and maintainability by
            incorporating type annotations and interfaces.

            TypeScript's type annotations serve as valuable documentation for functions and data structures,
            significantly reducing misunderstandings among team members and contributing to consistent coding practices.
            Additionally, TypeScript's ability to automatically infer types minimizes the need for explicit type
            declarations while maintaining strong typing.

            As a superset of JavaScript, TypeScript seamlessly integrates with existing JavaScript code and libraries,
            allowing for incremental adoption in projects. In summary, TypeScript proves to be an invaluable asset in
            web development, offering static typing, improved code quality, enhanced developer tooling, and
            compatibility within the JavaScript ecosystem. It fosters a safer and more maintainable development
            environment, especially in larger collaborative projects.
