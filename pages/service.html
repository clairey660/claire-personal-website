            <h3>Peer Teacher</h3>
            <p>
                I work for Texas A&M University as a Peer Teacher (PT).
                I understand that computer science concepts can often be new and challenging for
                many students, especially if they haven't been introduced to them before college. That's where PTs like
                me come in. We have a solid grasp of these computer science concepts and ideas, which allows us to
                provide personalized guidance to our fellow students.

                We are well-equipped to help
                students overcome any roadblocks they encounter in their work. When students face challenges, we serve
                as valuable resources, offering insights and solutions to navigate their academic journey.

                What sets PTs apart is that we've walked in the same shoes as the students we mentor. We understand the
                unique challenges and opportunities of these courses, and we're here to offer not only academic guidance
                but also encouragement and advice on how to succeed. Many freshmen find us more approachable than
                professors or teaching assistants (TAs), making it easier for them to seek help and thrive in their
                studies.
