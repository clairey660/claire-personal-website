        <h3>Skills:</h3>
        <p>
            I have learned many programming languages, including C++, C#, TypeScript,
            Python, Java, and Swift. My skills also include various development environments, where I'm comfortable
            in Windows, Linux, and macOS. With an eye for detail, I've developed my craft using IDEs such as Visual
            Studio Code, PyCharm, WebStorm, and Rider. Additionally, I bring practical experience in CAD modeling with
            SolidWorks. Beyond technical expertise, I excel in the soft skills essential for a collaborative and dynamic
            work environment. My determination, dedication, and organizational skills ensure I meet deadlines and
            acceptance criteria efficiently. Furthermore, my strong communication skills and detail-oriented approach
            consistently contribute to successful project outcomes.

        <h3>Interests:</h3>
        <p>
            I love front-end development because it's a unique blend of creativity and technicality. Crafting the
            user
            interface and user experience (UI/UX) is fun for me, as it allows me to blend my attention to detail with my
            passion for coding. Front-end development offers the opportunity to directly impact how
            users interact with a website or application, making it a pivotal part of the digital experience.

            Moreover, front-end development is at the forefront of innovations in web and app design. It's where
            responsive
            design, accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility are prioritized, emphasizing the importance of user
            inclusivity and reach. This aligns with my values of creating accessible and user-centric digital solutions.

            In essence, my interest in front-end development stems from the opportunity to bridge the gap
            between technology and user experience, fostering creativity while demanding a commitment to technical
            excellence and user satisfaction.
