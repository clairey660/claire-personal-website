        <h3>Scarcity, IOS app</h3>
        <p>
            I developed an iOS application using Swift, designed to engage users in building their own virtual zoo. The
            primary objective of this app was to educate students about the fundamental concept of scarcity. Within the
            app, users are given a designated area of land where they can strategically place carnival rides and
            animals. The ultimate goal of the game is to achieve a high score by making judicious choices regarding the
            selection and placement of various animals and attractions. These choices depend on the rarity of the items
            and the space required for each, thus challenging players to make resourceful decisions. Please note that
            the project is still a work in progress.
