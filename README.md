Internal Links:
Every page that you create must be linked from some other page.
The “Landing area” page must have links to all other pages.

External links:
Minimum of 10 different links to external web pages that are relevant to you and the work you are doing.
Appropriately placed throughout your project (not on a single “links” section).

Style toggle feature:
Completely changes the look, feel, and layout of the website. To accomplish this, do not edit your CSS from the initial design. Start over with a new CSS file, plan the layout, then implement the plan.  (Things like going to dark mode, changing background and font colors are not sufficient.)
Uses a toggle button that changes the appearance of the website by alternating between different CSS files with JavaScript.

TypeScript usage:
You must use TypeScript (do not use native JavaScript-only code).
Must demonstrate sufficient and appropriate coverage of TypeScript language features (e.g., explicit types) that will be checked by the TAs.
Your GitHub files must include both your original TypeScript files (.ts) and your auto-generated JavaScript files (.js).
The TAs will compile your TypeScript files to confirm that the auto-generated JavaScript files match those in your GitHub repository.
